# Screens + Shots

A health reminder app that allows users to stay on top of vaccines and cancer screenings. Users can create a simple profile with their age, gender, date of birth, and family history. The app then generates personalized recommendations and highlights the next upcoming reminder. Users can also view all reminders (including past and upcoming ones) and add custom reminders. This app makes it easy to ensure timely vaccinations for both children and adults, as well as cancer screenings for adults.
